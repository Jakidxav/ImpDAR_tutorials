    "# ImpDAR Getting Started Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to ImpDAR!\n",
    "This is an impulse radar processor primarily targeted toward ice-penetrating radar systems. However, the potential applications of this software are much more widespread. Our goal is to provide an alternative to the expensive commercial software that would be purchased with a ground-penetrating radar system from a company such as GSSI or Sensors and Software. We provide all of the processing tools that are needed to move from a raw data file to an interpretable image of the subsurface. Moreover, our software is agnostic to the system used, so we can import data from a variety of different ground-penetrating radar systems and interact with the data in the exact same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have not yet installed ImpDAR on your computer, you can go to our github page (https://github.com/dlilien/ImpDAR) to download or clone the repository. For those less familiar with Python programming, take a look at our Read the Docs page for help (https://impdar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred pathway for interacting with ImpDAR is through the terminal. However, our API allows relatively easy access through other programs as well. Here, we want to walk you through the processing flow using a Jupyter Notebook, where all of the processing functions can be called through Python. No prior knowledge of Python is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import the necessary libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first thing to do with any Python script is to import all of the libraries that will be used. These will allow us to call functions that help with loading scripts, some numerical issues, and plotting. Knowing exactly what each of these are is not important to understanding the radar processing flow. "

    "## Geometric Corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the data look like something useful, we can do a few more corrections to make it more physical. Two geometric corrections allow us to look at the image more like something under the surface instead of in this two-way travel time dimension that we have been using. First we crop out the 'pretrigger' which is data collected by the receiver before the radar pulse is actually transmitted. Second we do a 'normal move-out' correction (nmo) which corrects for the separation distance between the receiving and transmitting antennas. We have an additional tutorial for more details about the nmo filter in the case of a variable velocity (e.g. in snow or firn). After the nmo correction, we can more responsibly plot the y axis in 'depth' rather than 'travel time' by adding 'yd=True' in the plot function."

    "\n",
    "In cases where the GPS data are available, ImpDAR can load the data in, assigning lat/long to each trace. Then, the coordinates can be projected into x/y and a distance vector created for distance traversed along the profile. The final step is to interpolate the image onto equal trace spacing. All this is handled in the 'interp' function as seen below."
