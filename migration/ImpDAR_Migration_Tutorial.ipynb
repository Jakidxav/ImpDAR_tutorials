    "# ImpDAR Migration Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook functions as a sort of tutorial for the migration routines currently implemented in our geophysical processing toolkit for impulse radar (<a href=\"https://github.com/dlilien/ImpDAR\">ImpDAR</a>). First, I review a bit of the background on what migration is and why we need to use it to properly interpret geophysical datasets. I then describe the main groups of migration routines by stepping through a synthetic example, migrating the dataset with each method. I discuss the strengths and weaknesses for each as they come up as well as why one method may be chosen over another in a given case. Finally, I implement an actual data example from Hercules Dome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of this material, including the theory but also the algorithms themselves, is taken straight from the textbooks (i.e. Yilmaz, 2001; Sheriff and Geldart, 1995) as well as some of the primary literature (cited in line below).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Migration?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of migration is to transform a geophysical dataset into an image that accurately represents the subsurface stratigraphy. Migration is a mathematical transformation in which geophysical events (timing of wave return) are re-located to where the event (the reflection) occurred in the subsurface rather than the location that it was recorded at the surface. Because off-nadir information intrudes into each trace, the image must be migrated as a whole to describe the true reflector geometry. Migration adjusts the angle of dipping reflectors, shortens and moves reflectors updip, unravels bowties, and most generally collapses diffractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Raypaths_for_a_Dipping_Reflector.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The migration problem is illustrated in the image above. Dipping reflectors are imaged by an off-nadir ('apparent') reflection. The ray path of the apparent reflection is not the same as the depth of the reflector directly below the source. The _migrator's equation_ is a simple analytic way to adjust the angle of a dipping reflector,\n",
    "$$ tan(\\xi_a) = sin(\\xi) $$\n",
    "where $\\xi$ is the true reflector dip and $\\xi_a$ is the apparent dip shown in the unmigrated image. While this equation is useful, it does not provide the full capability of migrating a full geophysical image. To do that, I explore a few different methods below. \n",
    "\n",
    "_As a note: migration typically assumes coincident source and receiver, meaning that this processing step should be carried out after any stacking or move-out corrections._\n",
    "\n",
    "Migration methods outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Diffraction Stack Migration (i.e. Kirchhoff)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequency-Wavenumber Migration (e.g. Stolt, Gazdag, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finite-Difference Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "- SeisUnix Migration Routines (ImpDAR converts to .segy, does the migration in SU, then converts back)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Synthetic Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I create a synthetic domain to use as an example for the ImpDAR migration routines. For this case, the permittivity is elevated ($\\epsilon_r =$ 12 inside and 3.2 outside) within the dark blue box in the image below.\n",
    "<img src=\"./Box_Permittivity.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "Loading this domain into gprmax (a finite-difference time-domain modeling software), I simulate a common offset radar survey over the box with the output as a synthetic radargram. The source is a 3-MHz wave from a Hertzian Dipole antenna. Source-receiver antenna separation is 40 m, and the step size between traces is 4 m."

    "This synthetic image illustrates why we need to migrate. There are large hyperbola that extend away from the actual location of the box in both horizontal directions. These hyperbola, or diffraction curves, do not accurately represent the subsurface stratigraphy, they are only a result of imaging the box from the side as an off-nadir reflector.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1) Diffraction-Stack Migration -- 'Kirchhoff'\n",
    "\n",
    "The first migration method that I use here is the most direct to explain conceptually. Originally (~1920's), geophysical datesets were migrated by hand, and this method follows the logic used then. The energy along each diffraction curve is summed and placed at the apex of the curve (Hagedoorn, 1954). The diffraction curves are expected to be hyperbolic (in a constant velocity medium they will be), so here we iterate through each point of the image, looking for a hyperbolic diffraction curve and integrating the power along it."

This transformation is done in the frequency domain, so a 2-D Fourier transform is used in these methods. There are many such migration routines; here I highlight a couple popular ones.\n",

    "Stolt migration is great in places where the velocity is known to be constant. It is quite a bit faster than the other routines. Here though, we need to be careful about migrating power in from the edges of the domain, as can be seen in the lower corners above. For this reason, we apply a linear taper to the data so that the Fast Fourier Transform being used does not instantaneously switch from data to zeros around the edges.\n",

    "This second frequency wavenumber migration routines is actually a set of a few. A phase-shifting operator $e^{-ik_z z} is applied at each z-step in downward continuation. These methods are advantageous in that they allow variable velocity as one steps down. Generally, this only allows vertical velocity variation (which I explore here) but there is also a case which accomadates lateral velocity variation (phase-shift plus interpolation) which I will not describe here."
