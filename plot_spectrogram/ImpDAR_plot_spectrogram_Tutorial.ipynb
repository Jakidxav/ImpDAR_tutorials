    "Below are two Matlab files, one from a 2017 data collection season in the South Cascades, Washington state, and the other from a 2019 season at Hercules Dome, Antarctica. We have loaded these files into ImpDAR and converted them to RadarData objects to standardize their attribute names and metadata. After that, we cropped the data to remove the time delay at the top of the radargram. ImpDAR crops the data dynamically to allow you to remove the data collected as a result of the pre-trigger, which is how soon after you start collecting data that the transmitter actually sends out its first pulse. A very common next processing step is to vertically bandbass the data around some central frequency. This central frequency is determined by the type of antenna that is chosen to collect the data with. However, some antennas might not be tuned well, and so there actual central frequency can be very different than that listed for the antenna. The `plot_spectrogram()` method outlined below allows you to visually detect the central frequency that was used to collect the data, taking the guesswork out of the process. We use the [`signal.periodogram()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.signal.periodogram.html#scipy.signal.periodogram) method from SciPy which returns an estimate of the power spectral density. This calculates a Fast Fourier Transform and gives us back a histogram of representative frequencies in a signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: the `plot_spectrogram()` assumes that your data is in the frequency domain. A limitation of this is that it cannot be used for data in the power domain, which is unfortunate given some of the benefits of thinking in terms of power."

    "The Hercules Dome data is a little bit different than the South Cascade data in that it had an extra processing step done to it after being cropped but before needing to be bandpassed. We performed a normal moveout correction, about which there is another in-depth Jupyter Notebook tutorial within this repository. The short version of what this correction does is that describes the effect that the distance between a seismic source and a receiver (the offset) has on the arrival time of a reflection in the form of an increase of time with offset. So the NMO correction removes the “V” that we get from the antennae firing and when the signal is received later on as we move, then converts that signal to a fixed point. Note: this is not a full time to distance conversion because we don’t have velocity data.\n",

However, both sets of data could use more processing steps to further clean them up. Next, you could then interpolate, adaptively horizontally filter, and migrate the data. There is no need to migrate South Cascade data, it is mainly for removing the hyperbolae like in the Hercules Dome data. If you want to dig deeper into the migration routines that ImpDAR supports, there is another excellent tutorial within this repository."
